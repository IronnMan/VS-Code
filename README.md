# Interactive Editor Playground
The core editor in VS Code is packed with features. This page highlights a number of them and lets you interactively try them out through the use of a number of embedded editors. For full details on the editor features for VS Code and more head over to our [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs#vscode).

- Multi-cursor Editing - block selection, select all occurrences, add additional cursors and more
- IntelliSense - get code assistance and parameter suggestions for your code and external modules
- Line Actions - quickly move lines around to re-order your code.
- Rename Refactoring - quickly rename symbols across your code base.
- Refactoring via Extraction - quickly extract common code into a separate function or constant.
- Formatting - keep your code looking great with inbuilt document & selection formatting.
- Code Folding - focus on the most relevant parts of your code by folding other areas.
- Errors and Warnings - see errors and warning as you type.
- Snippets - spend less time typing with snippets.
- Emmet - integrated Emmet support takes HTML and CSS editing to the next level.
- JavaScript Type Checking - perform type checking on your JavaScript file using TypeScript with zero configuraion.


## Multi-Cursor Editing
Using multiple cursors allows you to edit multiple parts of the document at once, greatly improving your productivity. Try the following actions in the code block below:

1. Box Selection - press any combination of  `⇧⌥⌘↓`, `⇧⌥⌘→`, `⇧⌥⌘↑`, `⇧⌥⌘←` to select a block of text. You can also press `⇧⌥` while selecting text with the mouse.
2. Add a cursor - press `⌥⌘↑` to add a new cursor above, or `⌥⌘↓` to add a new cursor below. You can also use your mouse with `⌥+Click` to add a cursor anywhere.
3. Create cursors on all occurrences of a string - select one instance of a string e.g. `background-color` and press `⇧⌘L`. Now you can replace all instances by simply typing.

That is the tip of the iceberg for multi-cursor editing. Have a look at the selection menu and our handy [keyboard reference guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf) for additional actions.

> CSS Tipe: you may have noticed in the example above we also provide color swatches inline for CSS, additionally if you hover over an element such as `#p1` we will show how this is represented in HTML. These swatches also act as color pickers that allow you to easily change a color value. A simple example of some lanuage-specific editor features.
